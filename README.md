# Air-pollution-monitoring-system

This is IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System which measures indoor harmful gases present in air like Carbon Dioxide(CO2) using an MQ135 gas sensor and Carbon Monoxide(CO) using an MQ7 sensor. It will show the air quality in PPM(Parts Per Million) on the LCD and as well as on [Thingspeak](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1347787) so that we can monitor it very easily in PPM.

**Components Requirement:**

Arduino Uno

Wi-Fi module Node-MCU ESP8266

16x2 LCD

MQ135 Gas sensor

MQ 7 LPG gas sensor

Buzzer

LEDs
